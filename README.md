# Secret-Scouter 🎅

A Secret Santa style web-app for Scout groups accross the UK.

## Idea 💡

The app will register groups/sections interested in partaking in 'Secret Santa'. Once registered the group or section will be matched with another group somewhere in the UK, the group then need to create/build a present for their connected group, then ship the present at the beggining of December to their allocated group. There is a price limit on how much can be spent on the gift which is likely going to be around £10-15 including shipping.

Where it differs from _Secret Santa_ is that we will include a slip on where the gift has come from.. so that we can help create bonds between Scout groups/sections accross the UK.
